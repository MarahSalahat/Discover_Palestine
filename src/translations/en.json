      "name": "Mourid Barghouti",
      "shortBio": "A Palestinian poet and novelist known for his reflections on love and exile.",
      "fullBio": "Mourid Barghouti was born in a Palestinian village near Ramallah in 1944. His first exile began in 1967 while studying in Cairo, when the West Bank became inaccessible to him. In 1976, he was expelled from Egypt, and later from Lebanon and Jordan. During his time in Egypt, he left behind his wife, Radwa Ashour, a well-known writer and translator, and their infant son, Tamim. Exile deeply influenced his poetry, which often addresses the struggles of refugees. Barghouti believes that poetry, even visionary poetry, can speak to people under oppression. His poetry is characterized by its avoidance of rhetoric, opting instead for clear, visual language. This style is evident in his collections *Poems of the Pavement* (1980) and *Midnight and Other Poems* (2008), where he uses irony and humor without propaganda. His words reflect a profound, simple truth, as seen in his line, 'Silence said: truth needs no eloquence.' In 1998, Barghouti revisited Ramallah with his son, an experience he recorded in his book *I Saw Ramallah*. He now resides once again in Cairo.",
